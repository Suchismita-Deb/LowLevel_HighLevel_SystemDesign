Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern. When we create an object we follow this pattern.

When we have to create object based on condition.

For condition 1 create a object now for all the 1000 classes we have to add the conditions. 
ShapeFactory **has a** relation in the interface. ShapeFactory **has a** object of the interface Shape.
Class implements interface it **is a** relation.




Adding another class for the object creation so will just call the class. 
It is Simple Factory.
