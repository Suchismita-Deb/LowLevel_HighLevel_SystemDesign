### Design Video streaming platform.

First Functional and non functional requirements, DAU.

### Functional Requirements.

User should be able to upload a video.
User should get some recommended video in the home page and should be able to search the video.
Play the video.
User can use mobile, laptop. It should play in any device.

### Non Functional Requirements.

No buffering - (Sounds too ambitious we can manage it.)
No buffering meaning video should be available when user wants to play. Server serving the video should be responding in very low latency and should be available. No buffering meaning - low latency and high availability.

Increase the user session time. Need to make the user stay in the platform. No buffering and showing right content is important.

Issue I faced like when asked for Video streaming platform I was stick to the Youtube, It can be Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar. I say the term and make the conversation interesting.
